mtpoint - last finger reported

add mode to the debug_data struct (debug_data struct is now the most important)
- Ian to figure out ni_fp1000_data struct - throw in all things that change on the FP-1000, touchpoints, etc.
  - mode
  - touch_status
  - change app_data in ni_fp1000_ts.ko
  - latency test

- Common ni.h

verify touchpoint index

ni_device.c should be generic
device tree should configure - pass in pointers for devices, pass in width/height, etc. 

report data continously in apk

verify force correction

- scaling - scaled values at 2048
- scaling - force at 4096
- Keep capturing data in calibrate mode
- Toggle debug output in driver
- 

- Touch Status Calculation - Need to define band of sensor output (plus and minus). 
When sensors leave this band, it’s a touch event. When they return to the band 
(a bigger band) the touch event ends and auto cal begins

Major R&D efforts - Two touch with Force Correct (need to get Josh a phone for this)
